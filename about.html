<!--								<p>Hey there!<br>
									<br>
									Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm excited to give you a glimpse into my world and share what makes me tick. So, here's the scoop, including a touch of cybersecurity and software development:<br>
									<br>
									I'm a bit of a paradox—I consider myself an introverted extrovert. Being with friends and family brings me immense joy, but I also value my alone time to recharge and reflect. It's all about finding that perfect balance.<br>
									<br>
									Now, let's dive into my passions. Soccer is not just a game for me—it's a way of life. I'll never stop playing, and you'll often find me chasing that ball with all my heart. When I'm not on the field, I'm an avid consumer of movies, TV series, and anime. They transport me to different worlds and provide a much-needed escape. Plus, I take immense pleasure in whipping up delicious vegetarian meals in the kitchen. Cooking is my creative outlet.
									<p>
									Sports, in general, hold a special place in my heart. But if you're up for a challenge, let's battle it out on FIFA. I bet I can give you a run for your money. Ready to prove me wrong? Bring it on!
									</p>
									<p>
									Nature has a way of rejuvenating my soul, and I find solace in hiking through scenic trails. And what's life without music? Lately, I've been captivated by the enchanting melodies of classical and jazz. They ignite my imagination and fuel my creativity.
									</p><p>
									Now, let's talk about my passion for cybersecurity and software development. I find tremendous joy in solving intricate puzzles and exploring the digital realm. Capture the flag challenges are my thing—I immerse myself in research, embrace trial and error, and harness my intuition to unravel complex problems. I love the rush of discovering vulnerabilities and crafting secure solutions.
									</p><p>
									But that's not all! Software development is another avenue where I thrive. I enjoy building innovative solutions, crafting elegant code, and watching my ideas come to life. I'm always up for a coding adventure, eager to tackle new projects and expand my knowledge in this ever-evolving field.
									</p><p>
									When it comes to challenges, I don't believe in the concept of "hard." With dedication, research, and a dash of creativity, I firmly believe that any problem can be conquered. I'm a natural problem solver, and I'm here to deliver solutions or, at the very least, offer insights to propel us forward.
									</p><p>
									So, if you're ready to embark on an exciting journey together, let's connect! We'll tackle obstacles head-on, create remarkable things, and push the boundaries of what's possible. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I can't wait to connect with you!
									</p><p>
									Best, <br>
									Anjal Gajurel</p>
